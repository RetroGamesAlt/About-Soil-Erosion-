When we hike through the woods, drive by a cornfield, or mow our lawns, we tend to focus on the plants: the blooming flowers, the tassel-topped stalks, and the green grass borders. But what about the dirt? It seems soil is one of the planet’s most underappreciated natural resources. Yet healthy soil is the foundation for agriculture; it also plays a vital role in protecting the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat—and even our climate.

On the flip side, unhealthy soil can cause major trouble. Think of the 1930s, the era of the Dust Bowl. After many years of overplowing, poor land management, and drought, millions of acres of formerly productive farmland in the Midwest and Southern Plains dried up. A single dust storm could transport 300 million tons of soil all the way to the East Coast. Not only were vast areas of land severely damaged, but countless farm animals suffocated from the thick clouds of fine dust, and tragically, about 7,000 people perished from an illness called “dust pneumonia.” In April 1935, Congress declared soil erosion “a national menace” and established the Soil Conservation Service—known today as the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)—within the U.S. Department of Agriculture to instruct farmers on how to prevent erosion.
